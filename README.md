# Minesweeper
Hello,I am Borimir and this is my Minesweeper game,which is a console game.
There are some of the functionalities:
-GameMap(which can be from 3x3 up to 10x10)
-mines that are randomly generated
-three commands to play the game-(open,mark,unmark)
 -(open) opens the space that you have chosen and if there is a bomb,you lose.
	If not it shows you how many bombs there are around it.
 -(mark) marks the space with a flag(if you think there is a bomb),and if you have marked every
	space where there is a bomb,and the other spaces are opened,you win.
 -(unmark)If you think that you have made a wrong decision with putting the flags,you can take
	it back.(works only if you have a flag in these coordinates).
-also there are validations for the moves and commands you chose to make.

At the end of the game,whether you win or lose the map will be printed with the bombs.
